    # simple usage
    my $mcpan  = MetaCPAN::Client->new();
    my $author = $mcpan->author('XSAWYERX');
    my $dist   = $mcpan->distribution('MetaCPAN-Client');

    # advanced usage with cache (contributed by Kent Fredric)
    use CHI;

    use MetaCPAN::Client;

    my $mcpan = MetaCPAN::Client->new(
      ua => HTTP::Tiny::Mech->new(
        mechua => WWW::Mechanize::Cached->new(
          cache => CHI->new(

            root_dir => '/tmp/metacpan-cache',

      ),
    );

    # now $mcpan caches results

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a hopefully-complete API-compliant client to MetaCPAN
(L<https://metacpan.org>) with DWIM capabilities, to make your life easier.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 request

Internal attribute representing the request object making the request to
MetaCPAN and analyzing the results. You probably don't want to set this, nor
should you have any usage of it.

=head2 ua

If provided, L<MetaCPAN::Client::Request> will use the user agent object
instead of the default, which is L<HTTP::Tiny>.

Then it can be used to fetch the user agent object used by
L<MetaCPAN::Client::Request>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 author

    my $author = $mcpan->author('XSAWYERX');
    my $author = $mcpan->author($search_spec);

Finds an author by either its PAUSE ID or by a search spec defined by a hash
reference. Since it is common to many other searches, it is explained below
under C<SEARCH SPEC>.

Return a L<MetaCPAN::Client::Author> object on a simple search (PAUSE ID), or
a L<MetaCPAN::Client::ResultSet> object propagated with
L<MetaCPAN::Client::Author> objects on a complex (L<search spec based|/"SEARCH SPEC">) search.

=head2 module

    my $module = $mcpan->module('MetaCPAN::Client');
    my $module = $mcpan->module($search_spec);

Finds a module by either its module name or by a search spec defined by a hash
reference. Since it is common to many other searches, it is explained below
under C<SEARCH SPEC>.

Return a L<MetaCPAN::Client::Module> object on a simple search (module name), or
a L<MetaCPAN::Client::ResultSet> object propagated with
L<MetaCPAN::Client::Module> objects on a complex (L<search spec based|/"SEARCH SPEC">) search.

=head2 distribution

    my $dist = $mcpan->distribution('MetaCPAN-Client');
    my $dist = $mcpan->distribution($search_spec);

Finds a distribution by either its distribution name or by a search spec
defined by a hash reference. Since it is common to many other searches, it is
explained below under C<SEARCH SPEC>.

Return a L<MetaCPAN::Client::Distribution> object on a simple search
(distribution name), or a L<MetaCPAN::Client::ResultSet> object propagated with
L<MetaCPAN::Client::Distribution> objects on a complex (L<search spec based|/"SEARCH SPEC">)
search.

=head2 file

Return a L<MetaCPAN::Client::File> object.

=head2 favorite

Return a L<MetaCPAN::Client::Favorite> object.

=head2 rating

Return a L<MetaCPAN::Client::Rating> object.

=head2 release

    my $release = $mcpan->release('MetaCPAN-Client');
    my $release = $mcpan->release($search_spec);

Finds a release by either its distribution name or by a search spec defined by
a hash reference. Since it is common to many other searches, it is explained
below under C<SEARCH SPEC>.

Return a L<MetaCPAN::Client::Release> object on a simple search (release name),
or a L<MetaCPAN::Client::ResultSet> object propagated with
L<MetaCPAN::Client::Release> objects on a complex (L<search spec based|/"SEARCH SPEC">) search.

=head2 reverse_dependencies

    my $deps = $mcpan->reverse_dependencies('ElasticSearch');

all L<MetaCPAN::Client::Release> objects of releases that are dependent
on a given module, returned as L<MetaCPAN::Client::ResultSet>.

=head2 rev_deps

Alias to C<reverse_dependencies> described above.

=head2 recent

    my $recent = $mcpan->recent(10);
    my $recent = $mcpan->recent('today');

return the latest N releases, or all releases from today.

returns a L<MetaCPAN::Client::ResultSet> of L<MetaCPAN::Client::Release>.

=head2 pod

Not implemented yet.

=head2 BUILDARGS

Internal construction wrapper. Do not use.

=head1 SEARCH SPEC

The hash-based search spec is common to many searches. It is quite
feature-rich and allows to disambiguate different types of searches.

Basic search specs just contain a hash of keys and values:

    my $author = $mcpan->author( { name => 'Micha Nasriachi' } );

    # the following is the same as ->author('MICKEY')
    my $author = $mcpan->author( { pauseid => 'MICKEY' } );

    # find all people named Dave, not covering Davids
    # will return a resultset
    my $daves = $mcpan->author( { name => 'Dave *' } );

=head2 OR

If you want to do a more complicated query that has an I<OR> condition,
such as "this or that", you can use the following syntax with the C<either>
key:

    # any author named "Dave" or "David"
    my $daves = $mcpan->author( {
        either => [
            { name => 'Dave *'  },
            { name => 'David *' },
        ]
    } );

=head2 AND

If you want to do a more complicated query that has an I<AND> condition,
such as "this and that", you can use the following syntax with the C<all>
key:

    # any users named 'John' with a Gmail account
    my $johns = $mcpan->author( {
        all => [
            { name  => 'John *'     },
            { email => '*gmail.com' },
        ]
    } );

=head2 NOT

If you want to filter out some of the results of an either/all query
adding a I<NOT> filter condition, such as "not these", you can use the
following syntax with the C<not> key:

    # any author named "Dave" or "David"
    my $daves = $mcpan->author( {
        either => [
            { name => 'Dave *'  },
            { name => 'David *' },
        ],
        not => [
            { email => '*gmail.com' },
        ],
    } );

=head1 DESIGN

This module has three purposes:

=over 4

=item * Provide 100% of the MetaCPAN API

This module will be updated regularly on every MetaCPAN API change, and intends
to provide the user with as much of the API as possible, no shortcuts. If it's
documented in the API, you should be able to do it.

Because of this design decision, this module has an official MetaCPAN namespace
with the blessing of the MetaCPAN developers.

Notice this module currently only provides the beta API, not the old
soon-to-be-deprecated API.

=item * Be lightweight, to allow flexible usage

While many modules would help make writing easier, it's important to take into
account how they affect your compile-time, run-time, overall memory
consumption, and CPU usage.

By providing a slim interface implementation, more users are able to use this
module, such as long-running processes (like daemons), CLI or GUI applications,
cron jobs, and more.

=item * DWIM

While it's possible to access the methods defined by the API spec, there's still
a matter of what you're really trying to achieve. For example, when searching
for I<"Dave">, you want to find both I<Dave Cross> and I<Dave Rolsky> (and any
other I<Dave>), but you also want to search for a PAUSE ID of I<DAVE>, if one
exists.

This is where DWIM comes in. This module provides you with additional generic
methods which will try to do what they think you want.

Of course, this does not prevent you from manually using the API methods. You
still have full control over that, if that's what you wish.

You can (and should) read up on the general methods, which will explain how
their DWIMish nature works, and what searches they run.
